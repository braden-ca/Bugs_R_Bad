# TaskMaster

TaskMaster is a simple web application designed to help you keep track of all your tasks whether it's a day-to-day task or school tasks. Once you open up the website, it will show you all the tasks that you have due today, tasks that are overdue as well as your upcoming tasks. It will also give you the option to add more tasks. Each task has a name, description, due date and a priority (1, 2, or 3). Users can click each task to view, edit or delete it.

## Getting Started

Installation instructions: 
 1. Clone the repository: git clone ....
 2. Downloaded any of the extensions you dont't have already so the code will compile.
 3. To run it first with the backend open a terminal and run npm start and that will run the backend on the localhost:3000 server.
 4. To run the frontend open a seperate terminal and run python3 -m htpps.server and that will run the frontend on localhost:8000.
 5. Now you will have bot hservers up and running and you will need to type in localhost:8000 into a web browser to pull it up and from there you are all set up and ready to use TaskMaster.  

## Features

Add tasks: Users can add tasks to the list along with a description, due date and a priority number.
Edit tasks: Users can edit any task that is currently in the list. They can edit the name of the tasks, the description, the due date of the task or the priority number of the task.
Delete tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
Filtering: Users can easily find tasks as they are sorted and filtered based on the task's due date and priotity.

## Usage Examples

TaskMaster can be very useful for both students, that have to keep track of their homework assignments, as well as non-students that need a little help to keep track of the tasks that they need to get done through the week/month. Wether it's a school assignment or a doctor's appointment, you can easily forget these day-to-day tasks, but with one look at TaskMaster every night before you go to sleep, you will always know what you have ahead of you and are less likely to miss important assignments, appointments or other important tasks/events.
TaskMaster is useful to keep track of your assignments as it shows you right away the most urgent tasks such as the tasks that are due today as well as overdue tasks.
TaskMaster is also very simple and straight forward, so anyone can use it to their advantage.
