# TaskMaster

TaskMaster is a simple web application designed to help you keep track of all your tasks whether it's a day-to-day task or school tasks. Once you open up the website, it will show you all the tasks that you have due today, tasks that are overdue as well as your upcoming tasks. It will also give you the option to add more tasks. Each task has a name, description, due date and a priority (1, 2, or 3). Users can click each task to view, edit or delete it.

## Usage Examples

TaskMaster can be very useful for both students, that have to keep track of their homework assignments, as well as non-students that need a little help to keep track of the tasks that they need to get done through the week/month. Wether it's a school assignment or a doctor's appointment, you can easily forget these day-to-day tasks, but with one look at TaskMaster every night before you go to sleep, you will always know what you have ahead of you and are less likely to miss important assignments, appointments or other important tasks/events.
TaskMaster is useful to keep track of your assignments as it shows you right away the most urgent tasks such as the tasks that are due today as well as overdue tasks.
TaskMaster is also very simple and straight forward, so anyone can use it to their advantage.
